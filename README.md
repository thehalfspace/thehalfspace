I'm Prithvi Thakur, a PhD student at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. I work on numerical simulation of earthquake cycles. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a spectral-element code for earthquake cycle simulations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ableton Live, Hugo, Davinci Resolve.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on MPI based parallelization of my [spectral element code](https://github.com/thehalfspace/Spear) to simulate earthquake cycles.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning GPU programming.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything (SFW only pls)!
